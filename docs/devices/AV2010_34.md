## Notes


### Pairing
Press and hold the function key on the top of the sensor for about 10 seconds until the red LED briefly lights up once.
During the search, the LED lights up red once every 10 seconds. When the LED flashes 2 times, the device has successfully registered.


## Troubleshooting

### Not receiving any actions

In order to receive the `recall_*` action events, the device must be added to a group. There does not need to be any other members of the group.
To do this read the [groups documentation](/information/groups.html).


### Deprecated click event
By default this device exposes a deprecated `click` event. It's recommended to use the `action` event instead.

To disable the `click` event, set `legacy: false` for this device in `configuration.yaml`. Example:

```yaml
devices:
  '0x12345678':
    friendly_name: my_device
    legacy: false
```

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `legacy`: Set to `false` to disable the legacy integration (highly recommended!) (default: true)
